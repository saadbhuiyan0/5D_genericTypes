# use standard `ArrayList`

Improve
[OrderedList_inArraySlots_v1](https://github.com/stuyvesant-cs/solutionsHolmes/tree/master/5B_OrderedList_inArraySlots_v1)
by replacing
the encapsulated List_inArraySlots
with Java's standard ArrayList,
without breaking the contract with the user.

Start here, to base your work on knowledge rather than guesses:
