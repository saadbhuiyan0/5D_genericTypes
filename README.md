# generic types

exercises in using classes that are parameterized with
generic types

## in [`Pair` example](https://github.com/stuyvesant-cs/solutionsHolmes/tree/master/2019-04-05_PairOfGenerics)

For each item in this section, find exemplifying code in the `Pair` example.

- (an example of this task) the declaration of a `main` method:
```
public static void main(String[] args)
```
in [UserSavedByCompiler](https://github.com/stuyvesant-cs/solutionsHolmes/blob/21b641c9dda3c43d3e71de138c24c29f11687d88/2019-04-05_PairOfGenerics/UserSavedByCompiler.java#L11)


- definition that a class / type that is parameterized by a generic type, `T`:
```
your exemplifying line from the Pair example here
```
in [class](URL)


- declaration of a variable that can hold a reference to an instance
of such a class:
```
your exemplifying line from the Pair example here
```
in [class](URL)


- assignment to such a variable:
```
your exemplifying line from the Pair example here
```
in [class](URL)


- declaration of a method that returns an instance of such a type:
```
your exemplifying line from the Pair example here
```
in [class](URL)


- successful instantiation of an instance of such a class:
```
your exemplifying line from the Pair example here
```
in [class](URL)


- *un*successful instantiation of an instance of such a class,
caught by the compiler:
```
your exemplifying line from the Pair example here
```
in [class](URL)


- a variable that can hold a reference to an instance of the generic type
in a class / type that is parameterized by a generic type:
```
your exemplifying line from the Pair example here
```
in [class](URL)


- the declaration of a method that accepts a parameter of a generic type:
```
your exemplifying line from the Pair example here
```
in [class](URL)


- the declaration of a method that returns a value of a generic type:
```
your exemplifying line from the Pair example here
```
in [class](URL)
